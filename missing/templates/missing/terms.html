    Missingperson.com.ng provide a platform where the public can
    upload missing people and also check regularly to take note of
    faces incase they come across any.This platform has been created
    to help tackle the issue of missing people in the nation. This is
    a serious situation in which the crushing effect can have a long
    lasting damaging effect on any family.

  <p style="font-size: larger;margin-bottom: 20px;">
    For this reason, we want our users to be responsible enough to
    know the delicate nature of their actions by not just posting out
    of panick or to prank but to post only real cases of missing
    people.

    Many children have been traded and uploading them here can help
    reunite them to their parents. We are not promising that we will
    find any missing person but our platform is a hub which makes it
    easier for a wider reach and a higher chance of sombody coming
    across any known face.
